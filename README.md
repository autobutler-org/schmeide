# schmeide

The autobutler-org software factory. The design is in progress, so the binary only prints usage for now.

## Development

Requires Go and `make`; the Go toolchain version pinned in `go.mod` is downloaded automatically.

```sh
make build   # build ./build/schmeide
make test    # run tests
make check   # lint (golangci-lint, applies autofixes)
make format  # format
make help    # list all targets
```
